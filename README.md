# Muhammad Ibraheem's Portfolio

A modern, minimalist single-page portfolio website hosted on GitHub Pages.

## Agent guide
See `AGENTS.md` for a repository map and editing guardrails (useful for AI agents and new contributors).

## About Me
I’m a Master’s student in Robotics and Autonomous Systems at Arizona State University. My interests include robotics foundation models and decision-making for embodied systems, with ongoing work in legged locomotion and optimal control via reinforcement learning.

## Features
- Clean, minimalist design
- Responsive layout
- Interactive sidebar navigation (desktop collapse + mobile overlay)
- Smooth scrolling + active section highlighting
- Sections for academic background, experience, projects, interests, and contact

## Technologies Used
- HTML5
- CSS3
- JavaScript
- Modern CSS features (Grid, Flexbox, CSS Variables)

## Setup
No build process required — it’s a static website.

Option A (simple):
- Open `index.html` directly in your browser

Option B (recommended):
- Run a local static server from the repo root:
	- `python3 -m http.server 8000`
	- then open `http://localhost:8000`
